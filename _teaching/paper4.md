International nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) play an increasingly important role in global governance. Without coercive capacities, INGOs must build their authority in order to be heard, and ideally, influential in global governance. However, we know little about how INGOs build and defend their authority in practice. We argue that mission statements characterise how INGOs make authority claims to their audiences. Based on existing research on INGOs and global governance, we identify five dimensions of authority: accountability, representativeness, effectiveness, legality, and universal morality. We argue that the status of INGOs provides a useful insight into how INGOs make authority claims on those dimensions. We analyse the mission statements of 11 leading INGOs (high status) and 46 other INGOs (low status) from 2003 and 2013. We find that leading INGOs are more likely to emphasise accountability and legality while other INGOs are more likely to highlight representativeness. Our findings highlight strategic concerns facing INGOs in building and defending their authority, opening up an exciting research agenda to study how authority relationships are constructed in global civil society.
