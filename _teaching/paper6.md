Organizational ecology has attracted growing interest in the study of global governance in recent years. As a structural theory, however, organizational ecology does not offer much insight into the feedback effects of organizational choices on global governance. Focusing on the agenda-setting role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), I theorize how the choice of specialism or generalism can explain changes in political environments, namely the salience of particular issues in global governance.  I exploit the unique features of wildlife conservation as an issue area in order to devise empirical tests for specialist NGO influence. My quantitative analysis shows that specialist NGOs better explain the variation of issue salience than leading, generalist NGOs. I then explore the mechanisms of influence in the case studies of pangolin, whale, and elephant conservation. Based on in-depth interviews with conservation NGOs, I illustrate a variety of organizational strategies for specialization. My findings challenge the conventional wisdom of NGO advocacy that small NGOs are free-riders of leading NGOs' advocacy resources. As a corrective to ecological theories in IR, my argument invites scholars to pay attention to the consequences of agentic actions in global governance.
