Private transnational organizations have grown in number and in influence. However, sociologists and political scientists often study them separately, either as transnational social movement organizations (TSMOs) or the larger category of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). TSMOs are defined in terms of their aspiration to fight against dominant political order. Does the difference between TSMOs and INGOs justify the disciplinary gap? In this manuscript, I call for bridging the gap by exploring how organizational legitimacy is constructed among TSMOs. Drawing on the insights of INGO networks, I investigate factors associated with the legitimacy of TSMOs. Empirically, I find that legitimation benefits already prominent organizations than those that are not. Networking thus helps reproduce the hierarchy among the TSMOs, challenging the earlier notion that TSMOs are horizontally networked. However, I also find that Southern TSMOs are more likely to gain legitimacy than Northern TSMOs once they are visible to their peers. The analysis of TSMOs thus cautions our bias to study Northern INGOs and generalize the findings to INGO population. Overall, my findings reveal that the incentives and strategies that INGO research has documented exist among TSMOs despite the disciplinary divide.
