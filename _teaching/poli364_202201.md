Since the mid-20th century, international organizations (IOs) have grown in number and influence. Today, IOs govern, or attempt to govern, many areas of world politics. This course will examine major theoretical approaches to the study of IOs. We will then carefully review how IOs govern major issue areas of world politicsâ€”security, finance, human rights, and environment.
