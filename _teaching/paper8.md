Over the course of 25 years, the number and types of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) participating in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have dramatically increased. Today, environmental NGOs are not the only NGOs seen at UNFCCC annual meetings (COPs); justice, women, and indigenous NGOs also participate in COPs. They have developed climate change discourse that is not just about climate science. What frames around climate change have been developed by the NGOs at UNFCCC? Who are the main drivers of specific frames? Existing research often reduces the diversity of frames to different types of NGOs but overlooks the multidimensional nature of framing efforts. This project seeks to remedy this reductionist approach. We outline our project's motivation and approach to study climate change discourse at UNFCCC COPs.
