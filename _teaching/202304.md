In a globalized world, can we really do only *one* thing? How do we stop or start the chain of political reactions? The concept of networks helps us understand and explain the complex nature of todayâ€™s global politics. This course begins with the premise that network theory is not just a methodological toolkit but is a set of propositions about global politics. We then apply network perspectives in major themes in global politics, including war and peace, regime change, economic interdependence, international organizations, and non-state actors. You will use acquired knowledge to identify a research problem and present a research strategy based on network research.
