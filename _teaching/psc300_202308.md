Global environmental problems, such as climate change, marine resource depletion, and species extinction, demand collaboration beyond national borders. This course examines how we attempt to solve global environmental problems â€“ and why we often fail. You will learn key social scientific theories to understand the past and current efforts to solve (or postpone) global environmental challenges. It highlights a wide variety of actors and approaches in environmental governance so that you will be able to analyze real-world, environmental problems from multiple angles.
