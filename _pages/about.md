Thank you for visiting my website! This is where you can find the most up-to-date information about my research and teaching. 

I am an Assistant Professor of International Relations at Duke Kunshan University. My research examines the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in global governance. I am particularly interested in the strategies of small NGOs to survive and be influential in the governance of biodiversity and climate change. My work appears in *International Studies Quarterly*, *Global Environmental Politics*, *Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly*, and *Global Society*, among others.

My other interests include civil society participation in intergovernmental organizations, informational environments of NGOs in democratic and non-democratic countries, and different interpretations of "conservation" among the public. My teaching interests are in the areas of international relations, civil society organizations, and global environmental governance.

Before starting at Duke Kunshan, I held postdoctoral positions at the European University Institute and the University of Calgary. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Toronto. I hold an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Toronto and an LL.B. from Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan.
