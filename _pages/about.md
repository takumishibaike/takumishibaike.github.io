Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. My research examines how nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) shape our understanding of “important” issues in global governance. I am particularly interested in the strategies of small NGOs to survive and be influential in the governance of biodiversity and climate change. In my empirical research, I use mixed-methods, including survey experiments, computational text analysis (machine learning), social network analysis, and in-depth interviews.

My other interests include civil society participation in intergovernmental organizations, the informational environments of NGOs in democratic and non-democratic countries, and the different understanding of “conservation” among the public. My teaching interests are in the areas of international relations, environmental governance, and empirical methodologies in political science.

Before starting at the University of Calgary, I held a postdoctoral fellowship in the Max Weber Programme for Postdoctoral Studies at the European University Institute (2020-2021). I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Toronto (2020). I hold an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Toronto (2015) and an LL.B. from Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan (2013).
