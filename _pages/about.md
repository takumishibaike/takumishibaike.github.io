Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science in the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at [Syracuse University](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/academics/political-science-department){:target="_blank"}. My research examines the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in global governance. I am particularly interested in the strategies of small NGOs to survive and be influential in the governance of biodiversity and climate change. My work appears in *International Studies Quarterly*, *Global Environmental Politics*, *Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly*, and *Global Society*, among others.

My other interests include civil society participation in intergovernmental organizations (UNFCCC, OAU, RFMOs), informational environments of NGOs in democratic and non-democratic countries, and different interpretations of "conservation" among the public. My teaching interests are in the areas of international relations, civil society organizations, and global environmental governance.

Before starting at Syracuse University, I was an Assistant Professor at [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} and held postdoctoral positions at the [University of Calgary](https://www.policyschool.ca/){:target="_blank"} and the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/max-weber-programme-for-postdoctoral-studies){:target="_blank"}. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the [University of Toronto](https://politics.utoronto.ca/){:target="_blank"}.
